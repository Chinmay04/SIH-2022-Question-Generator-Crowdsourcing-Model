# PROPOSED SYSTEM
➢ On our portal, Department of School Education & Literacy (DoSEL) will be the highest authority, it will 
add the education boards(State, Central, etc). 

➢ Boards will add Institutes (school and college) under it, it will also decide and add subjects/sub-topics.

➢ Institute will add the teachers/professors under it, teachers will be contributors by default.

➢ Anyone can become a contributor, a person has to give an application to the board to become a 
contributor, after board approves his/her request then only he/she will become a contributor, and 
they can add the questions to the Question Pool.

➢ The questions will be examined by experts, Experts can accept or reject the questions from the 
question pool.

➢ There will be different formats of objectives, contributors can specify the level of questions. (easy, 
medium, hard)

➢ The system will also allow the board and the teachers to automatically generate question papers of a 
particular subject consisting of the desired number of questions with desired difficulty level from the 
question pool that the system has.

➢ This portal will be able to generate mass questions and on the other hand, it will be saved from 
getting spammed as we verify the legitimacy of contributors
